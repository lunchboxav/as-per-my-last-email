<p>To those who wonder, this simple website is basically collection of notes I wrote in plain HTML, cobbled up into
  proper homepage based on an HTML template, using JS. I use Bun as the main build tool. Styling is plain CSS. No other frameworks or database
  is used (so, no React, Svelte, nor Tailwind), I may consider adding database when a feature needs it.</p>
