<p>Platform is a mindset. Here's why:
<ol>
  <li>In a modern software engineering practice, it makes sense to craft software as a platform. Engineers are tasked to
    create working system, where everyone from different roles can contribute to the end product in a self service
    manner. Marketing can easily add a page or change a copywriting to a specific section, test it in staging, and get
    approval from the PM before seeing this change goes into production.
  </li>
  <li>This approach allows domain owners to be within arms length of the product feedback loop, instead of waiting for
    days for changes to happen
  </li>
  <li>First, make it work (this is the MVP), then make it collaborative</li>
</ol>
