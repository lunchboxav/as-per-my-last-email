  <p>Platform is a mindset. Here's why:
<ol>
  <li>In a modern software engineering practice, it makes sense to craft software as a platform. Engineers are tasked to
    create working system, where everyone from different roles can contribute to the end product in a self service
    manner. Marketing can easily add a page or change a copywriting to a specific section, test it in staging, and get
    approval from the PM before seeing this change goes into production.
  </li>
  <li>This approach allows domain owners to be within arms length of the product feedback loop, instead of waiting for
    days for changes to happen
  </li>
  <li>First, make it work (this is the MVP), then make it collaborative</li>
</ol>

  The true competitor of an internal developer portal: Slack and Spreadsheet, where tacit knowledge are one message away
  and visibility to information is one click away. If you're looking for self service capability benchmark, those are
  the measuring sticks. See if you can beat the efficiency of current practice.
