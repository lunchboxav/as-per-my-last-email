  <p>Modern software engineering is a team sport.</p>

  <p>Platform is a mindset. Here's why:
<ol>
  <li>In a modern software engineering practice, it makes sense to craft software as a platform. Engineers are tasked to
    create working system, where everyone from different roles can contribute to the end product in a self service
    manner. Marketing can easily add a page or change a copywriting to a specific section, test it in staging, and get
    approval from the PM before seeing this change goes into production.
  </li>
  <li>This approach allows domain owners to be within arms length of the product feedback loop, instead of waiting for
    days for changes to happen
  </li>
  <li>First, make it work (this is the MVP), then make it collaborative</li>
</ol>

  The true competitor of an internal developer portal: Slack and Spreadsheet, where tacit knowledge are one message away
  and visibility to information is one click away. If you're looking for self service capability benchmark, those are
  the measuring sticks. See if you can beat the efficiency of current practice.

  <p>One of the first thing that struck me when first transitioning into Product Manager role is this: I get to do more
  design as PM, compared to being a designer. I can drive the direction and shape of the product. I can craft the
  desired goal and experience. If those are not design, I don't know what else.</p>

  <p>To those who wonder, this simple website is basically collection of notes I wrote in plain HTML, cobbled up into
  proper homepage based on an HTML template, using JS. I use Bun as the main build tool. Styling is plain CSS. No other frameworks or database
  is used (so, no React, Svelte, nor Tailwind), I may consider adding database when a feature needs it.</p>
